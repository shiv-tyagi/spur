# Install a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner on mi300.
#
# Run this once on mi300 (ssh mi300, then bash setup-runner.sh <REPO> <TOKEN>).
#
# Get a registration token:
#   GitHub → repo → Settings → Actions → Runners → "New self-hosted runner"
#   Copy the token from the ./config.sh command shown there (--token <TOKEN>).
#   Tokens expire after 1 hour.
#
# Usage:
#   bash setup-runner.sh <owner/repo> <registration-token>
#
# Example:
#   bash setup-runner.sh powderluv/spur AABBBCCCC...
#
# After setup, the runner appears under Settings → Actions → Runners as "mi300-runner"
# with label "mi300x".  It connects outbound to GitHub (port 443) — no inbound ports
# are needed and no IPs appear in the workflow files.
